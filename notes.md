Ringojs might be a good alternative to node.js, because it supports real threads and shared memory (not just copying around, like WebWorkers).  JS engines are heading toward this, but they're not there, yet.  Maybe we can keep Plexus bound to cC for a while until shared memory/threads really works in browsers?
